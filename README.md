# pyoganesson

A pure Python implementation of the Oganesson messaging framework.

## Description

Oganesson is an MIT-licensed application messaging framework which utilizes modern cryptography to provide secure, easy-to-manage messaging over networks. It is inspired by ZeroMQ but meant to be simpler and only offer encrypted messaging. Currently the only usage pattern supported is the requester-responder pattern, although others may be implemented a a future time.

## Status

Oganesson is still under active development and not quite ready for production use just yet. By extension, pyoganesson is not ready for production use, but both should reach beta in the near future.
